# Deep Sky Workflows

Welcome to the repository for my astrophotography projects! This repository contains code, scripts, and documentation for processing deep sky images (and a few planetary ones) using [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com). Currently I'm using [Stellina](https://vaonis.com/stellina) for my captures.

Visit the [Deep Sky Workflows YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGTfyv52aBiubARo3t30MAQ) for related video tutorials.

Browse the photos I've taken in this [Google Astrophotography Album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FceFDGmLJ1Cy1WvZ6).
