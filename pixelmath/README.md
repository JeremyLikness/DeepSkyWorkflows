# PixelMath

[PixelMath](http://www.deepskycolors.com/PixInsight/PixelMath.html) is a powerful, built-in function of PixInsight. This page shares some of my favorite implementations.

- [Hubble palette](./Hubble.md) is an artistic manipulation using the red, green, and blue channels.
- [Linear Fit](./LinearFit.md) is a rough approximation of what the Linear Fit tool does to normalize channels, only without having to extract and recombine them.
